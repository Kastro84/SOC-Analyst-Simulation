# Project 3 – Phishing Email Analysis & Containment

## Scenario Overview
A phishing email was flagged for review after being identified as suspicious. The focus of the investigation was to understand what the email was trying to do, how many users received it, and what actions were taken to remove it and prevent further exposure.

## Environment & Evidence Context


## Alert / Detection Trigger
The investigation was triggered after an email security alert flagged a message as potentially malicious. Indicators such as the sender details and embedded content suggested phishing activity, prompting further review to confirm the nature of the email and assess its impact.

## Email Analysis
The email was reviewed to understand how it was attempting to mislead users. The sender address and display name were checked for impersonation, and the email content was analysed for common phishing techniques such as urgency, misleading language, and suspicious links.

## Delivery Scope & Impact Assessment
The email was reviewed to understand how it was attempting to mislead users. The sender address and display name were checked for impersonation, and the email content was analysed for common phishing techniques such as urgency, misleading language, and suspicious links.

## Containment Actions
The phishing email was removed from affected mailboxes to prevent further interaction. Additional actions were taken to ensure similar messages would be blocked going forward, reducing the risk of repeat delivery.

## Findings & Correlation
The email was confirmed to be phishing based on the sender details and message content. The review showed limited delivery and no evidence of widespread exposure beyond the identified recipients.

## Analyst Decision Points
The main decision was whether further escalation or additional controls were required. Based on the limited delivery and successful removal of the email, no further escalation was necessary.

## Response & Decision
The email was removed, and no further action was required beyond monitoring. Users were advised to remain cautious of similar messages.

## Incident Closure
The incident was closed after confirming the phishing email had been successfully contained and no further exposure was identified.

## Notes / Lessons Learned
Quick review and removal of phishing emails helps reduce risk. Confirming delivery scope early allows containment actions to be taken efficiently.

## What Would Have Changed the Outcome
The response would have escalated if the email had been delivered to a wider group of users, showed signs of successful interaction, or bypassed existing email security controls.
