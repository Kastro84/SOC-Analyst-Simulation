## Incident Summary
An endpoint alert was raised for a user device after suspicious activity was detected. The purpose of the investigation was to understand what triggered the alert, assess whether the activity posed a real risk, and confirm that the device was not compromised.
## Detection / Alert Trigger
The investigation began after Microsoft Defender for Endpoint generated an alert indicating potentially suspicious behaviour on a user device. The alert required review to determine whether it represented a genuine security incident or a benign event.
## Scope of Investigation
The investigation focused on the affected endpoint, the alert details, and any related process or activity evidence. The review was limited to information available within Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and associated device views.
## Endpoint Context and Device Review
The investigation focused on the affected endpoint, the alert details, and any related process or activity evidence. The review was limited to information available within Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and associated device views.
## Alert Analysis
The affected device was reviewed to understand its general state at the time of the alert. This included checking the device type, operating system, risk level, and recent activity. The device did not show signs of widespread malicious behaviour or repeated alerts.
## Process and Behaviour Review
The alert details were reviewed to identify what behaviour caused the detection. This included reviewing the alert description, category, severity, and any evidence provided by Defender. The activity appeared limited and did not clearly indicate active malware execution.
## Correlation and Validation
Associated process activity was reviewed to understand what was running on the device at the time of the alert. The process behaviour was analysed to determine whether it was malicious or could be explained by normal user activity or legitimate software.
## Findings
The alert findings were correlated with device context and recent activity to validate whether the behaviour was isolated or part of a broader issue. No additional alerts or suspicious events were identified that would suggest a larger compromise.
## Response and Outcome
The investigation did not identify confirmed malware or ongoing malicious activity on the device. The alert appeared to be either a low-risk event or a benign activity that triggered a security detection.
## Incident Closure
No containment or remediation actions were required based on the findings. The alert was resolved after review, and the device was considered low risk at the conclusion of the investigation.
## Lessons Learned
Endpoint alerts should always be reviewed in context. Not all alerts indicate confirmed compromise, but timely investigation helps confirm risk levels and prevents potential escalation.
